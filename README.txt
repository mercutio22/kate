My attempt at analysing Kate's data

- used 'nextbio' to find correlated genes to  endometriosis ovarian cancer
- saw enrichment of 'src gene signature' in clear endometriosis cell
- wanted to see serous vs normal.


#Yamaguchi et al. data:
GEO datasets are: 
    GSE6008 including 99 samples (8 OCCC: 8, OS: 41, OM: 13, OE: 37) from the University of Michigan (Hendrix et al., 2006); 
    GSE2109 including 138 samples (OCCC: 11, OS: 87, OM: 13, OE: 27) from the Expression Project for Oncology (expO) (https://expo.intgen.org/geo/); 
    GSE4198 including 44 samples (OCCC: 6, OS: 38) from Stanford University (Schaner et al., 2003); 
    GSE3001 including 10 ovarian cancer cell lines (OCCC: 5, OS: 5) from Hiroshima University (Komatsu et al., 2006). 
    A dataset including 50 samples (OCCC: 9, OS: 23, OM: 9, OE: 9) was from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (PMID16144910) (Marquez et al., 2005)

R packages to download GEO data: GEO2R, GEOquery
